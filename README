A simple Greasemonkey-script to add links to all sorts of events (class-, exam- and signup-dates) 
occuring within the Vienna University of Technology's online portal (TISS).


Requires Greasemonkey (http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/)

Currently an alpha version.

Installation:
* drag into Greasemonkey-enabled browser.
* click 'Install'
* pretty much done =)
